== System Scope and Context


[role="arc42help"]
.What are the goals of the system?
The main idea of this project is to create a decentralised application to make routes for either running or whatever you wish
plus being able to share this routes that you make with your friends and being able to use theirs aswell, in other words
we are creating an application capable of connecting to SOLID, and using the SOLID tecnology, the SOLID pods, to let the
users communicate between them in a safe and fast way, based on the principle on not storing any user information, and just
allowing them to send it to the SOLID application.

.Use case
image::use_case.png[]
The communication is done throught the user´s pods. Anytime a user wants to store a route, or access to one
his petition is communicated to their pod, and then he is able to access one of their routes, or the one
their friends are sharing with them.

This section shows a representation of the communication partners and stakeholders of our system,
offering a more easy to understand graphical view of the business, and later explain more indepth
in the technical context.

=== Technical Context

****
For this applicacion we are using a couple of technologies, like SOLID, REACT, etc...
the main idea is building an applicacion working with the technologies we mentioned earlier
capable of working with SOLID and allowing SOLID users to save their routes and sharing them
with friends in a safe way, the base part of the applicacion is gonna be done using REACT, while
the communication is done using SOLID and its pods.
