== Risks and Technical Debts


[role="arc42help"]

The main problem in the development of the application is working with a new technology that isnÂ´t very extended. This collides with the lack of time

|===
| Priority         | Risk  | Consequence | Possible Solution
| 1     | New technology |  The project requires the usage of a new technology that is unknown for the developers | Initial period of investigation and learning of the needed tools

| 2     | Time management | The previous point means that the development period has to be delayed(since the devolopers need to learn how to use the tecnology) |  Rigurous organization and continuous communication between the members of the development team
| 3     | Team organization | Working with other people in a team always leads to some problems | Productive meetings, establishing the task of each member and writting them in reports

=== Technical Debts
There are some aspects of our application that could be improved:

* Don't support altitude: We create routes with latitude and longitude, but not with altitude.
* Group of friends: We don't have groups of friends to share routes. As an alternative, when you're going to share a route you can choose more than one friend thanks to a checkbox.
