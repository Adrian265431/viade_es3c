== Architecture Constraints


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)

=== Technical Constraints
[width="100%",options="header"]
|====================
| Code | Constraint | Explanation 
| TC01 | Implementation with React | The front-end will be developed with React, which is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows to compose complex IUs from single small pieces of code called components
| TC02 | Use of solid | The application must be developed following SOLID specifications with a decentralized control of user data
| TC03 | Cannot use a default pod | A pod will have to be implemented for each user of the application
| TC04 | Users will be able to visualize routes on a map | A geolocalization api will be used to show the users' routes 
| TC05 | Friend list | Users can have a friends list, which will be other users to share content with
| TC06 | Push notifications | The application should allow you to send and receive notifications when another user from an application wants to share a route
| TC07 | Interoperability | Routes loaded by users from other SOLID applications must be visible by the application
|====================

=== Organizative Constraints
[width="100%",options="header"]
|====================
| Code | Constraint | Explanation 
| OC01 | Time limit | The project must be completed by dd/MM/yyyy 
| OC02 | Project budget | In the absence of a budget, resources are limited
| OC03 | Testing | The application will be tested during its development to ensure its correct operation 
| OC04 | Team organization| The project will be developed in teams of 5-6 people
|====================

=== Conventions Constraints
[width="100%",options="header"]
|====================
| Code | Constraint | Explanation 
| CC01 | Version control source | Must be performed with Git, using the repository hosted in the GitHub service
| CC02 | Documentation | Implemented following the Arc42 structure template and using AsciiDoctor
| CC03 | Javascript code conventions | The code shoud follow the javascript code convections 
| CC04 | Node code conventions | The code shoud follow the node code convections 
| CC05 | React code conventions | The code shoud follow the react code convections
