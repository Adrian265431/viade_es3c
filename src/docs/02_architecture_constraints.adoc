== Architecture Constraints

=== Technical Constraints
[width="100%",options="header"]
|====================
| Code | Constraint | Explanation 
| TC01 | Implementation with React | The front-end will be developed with React, which is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows to compose complex IUs from single small pieces of code called components
| TC02 | Use of solid | The application must be developed following SOLID specifications with a decentralized control of user data
| TC03 | Cannot use a default pod | A pod will have to be implemented for each user of the application
| TC04 | Users will be able to visualize routes on a map | A geolocalization api will be used to show the users' routes 
| TC05 | Friend list | Users can have a friends list, which will be other users to share content with
| TC06 | Push notifications | The application should allow you to send and receive notifications when another user from an application wants to share a route
| TC07 | Interoperability | Routes loaded by users from other SOLID applications must be visible by the application

=== Organizative Constraints

|====================
| Code | Constraint | Explanation 
| OC01 | Time limit | The project must be completed by dd/MM/yyyy 
| OC02 | Project budget | In the absence of a budget, resources are limited
| OC03 | Testing | The application will be tested during its development to ensure its correct operation 
| OC04 | Team organization| The project will be developed in teams of 5-6 people

=== Conventions Constraints
[width="100%",options="header"]
|====================
| Code | Constraint | Explanation 
| CC01 | Version control source | Must be performed with Git, using the repository hosted in the GitHub service
| CC02 | Documentation | Implemented following the Arc42 structure template and using AsciiDoctor
| CC03 | https://travis-ci.org/[Travis] | We use it to deploy the project and we can test our libraries or applications against different configurations without having to have them installed locally
| CC04 | https://codecov.io/[Codecov] | We use it to check the test coverage 
| CC05 | https://app.codacy.com/[Codacy] | We use it to check the quality of our code
