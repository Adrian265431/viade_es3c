Once logged in correctly, the user has 2 main options: to create a new route or to view his saved routes.

=== New Route
To create a new route, the user must access the corresponding view of the application where a map is shown on which he must draw his route using points. Once drawn, the user must enter a name, a description, and if desired, photos and/or videos to save along with his route.

=== My Routes
In the application, there is a view that shows all the routes that the user has saved so far.
For each route you can see: name, author, description, the points of the route on the map and you can also share the route with your friends.

=== My Friends
This part of the application allows you to view the list of the user's friends in session. It is also possible to add and remove friends. After these two actions, the page where the friends are seen will be reloaded, allowing us to see the update of the list of our friends.
