Once logged in correctly, the user has 2 main options: to create a new route or to view his saved routes.

=== New Route
To create a new route, the user must access the corresponding view of the application where a map is shown on which he must draw his route using points. Once drawn, the user must enter a name, a description, and if desired, photos and/or videos to save along with his route.

=== My Routes
In the application, there is a view that shows all the routes that the user has saved so far.
For each route you can see: name, author, description, the points of the route on the map and you can also share the route with your friends.
