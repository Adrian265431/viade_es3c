== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== User Experience concepts (UX)
==== User interface:
We don't use the Bootstrap library we thought it would be better to give it our own style. In this way, we decided to make a js file for each component named ComponentName.style.js. 
Our app has two interfaces: on the one hand, the reused login of inrupt and the other part is found once the session is started. This last part is entirely done by us: it has a navigation bar that allows us to access the list of routes, friends, create new routes ... and in turn when entering these options we also find components of our creation and design.
We have some components in the containers folder: MyFriends that would allow adding, removing and listing friends thanks to the InfoFriends component; MyRoutes that allows us to view the list of routes and see the information of each one thanks to the InfoRoute component; New Route that allows us to create new routes by adding the name, description and multimedia files ... 

=== Domain concepts
Our domain diagram has three entities: one of them is the route that has a series of points and multimedia files. We also have the Point class that has the attributes longitude and latitude and the Multimedia class that counts on giving us information about the author, the date, the name, the url and the path they belong to since they are saved from that way in the pod the path will have a reference to the media files.
Next, we can see this domain model

=== Design patterns
Although we said that we would analyze this section more carefully later, we do not believe that we have used any specific design pattern. 

=== Architectural pattern
Something we are sure about is the arquitecture of our project. We are going to work with two arquitectural patterns: n layers pattern and MVC pattern. These patterns will allow us to develop a maintainable and scalable application. 
On the one hand, we want to use 3-layers pattern. This pattern will allow to separate the presentation of the application, business where we have the logic and the persistence which in our case we will store the information of each user in its pod.
Regarding the n-layer pattern, we could say that in some cases it was difficult to separate the business layer from persistence, since in some cases it did not require excessive complexity to obtain the data, for example in the case of friends. In this case, we use some React components that allow showing friends in the interface, but in the case of Routes it is much more complicated and it is necessary to obtain and parse those routes from the pod and then use a manager as an intermediate class as a service. that allows us to list those routes in the front. In other cases, such as adding or removing friends, we do use an intermediate class that allows us to remove and add them, but in this case we do not make a difference between the service layer and the persistence layer.

In addition, we are using React js to develop viade that also have its patterns. Content-container pattern is one of the ReactÂ´s pattern and it consist on divide the component into two components: one component is responsible for obtaining the information - the container - and another component shows the information that is passed through its properties - the content. 

=== Development concepts
We have to develop this application using React js and architecture SOLID. Moreover, we want to use Bootstrap library to simplify the design of the frontend. The app must meet the requirements so we are testing with diferent tools but we have not decided yet. In the end, as I said before, we did not use the Boostrap library since we wanted to make a design and a style of our own for our Viade application.

=== Security concepts
Today, the development of secure applications is one of the most important points. Therefore, our app is based on SOLID architecture so each user will identified itself with a WebId and it will deal with it personal data. When we are offered the option of sharing routes to maintain both the security and the right of our clients, what we do is give permissions to that route so that the friend can see the route instead of copying the route to his pod since this would imply less security and less privacy since the application would have more permissions than necessary
