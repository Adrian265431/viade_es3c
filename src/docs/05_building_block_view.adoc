== Building Block View

The section shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks as well as their dependencies.

As we have already said, we will follow SOLID architecture, so it is necessary to use the SOLID PODS.
The system will have three main elements which communicate each others:

    * User: users will use Viade to manage their routes.
    * PODS: they will storage information's users.
    * Viade: the app will communicate with users and pods.
